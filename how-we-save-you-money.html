        <h2>How We Help You Save Money</h2>
        <p>A "deal" represents an apartment or rental unit offering special incentives, such as free rent for a certain number of months, reduced prices, or waived fees.</p>
        <p>We source these offers directly from property managers and prioritize clear, trackable links so you can immediately view the listing.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to save you time and money by cutting through the noise and showing you genuine savings opportunities.</p>
